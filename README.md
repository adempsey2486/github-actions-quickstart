## Feedback on Documentation

I think overall this is a good step by step
description of how to setup a basic Github
Actions workflow, but I think it would be
helpful if the documentation went into a bit
more depth on the .yaml file used, perhaps
explaining its overall purpose, or explaining
line by line what each command does. Other
than that though, the steps are clear and easy
to follow and the page has lots of good
references for further Github Actions resources.
